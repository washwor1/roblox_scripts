# Roblox Scripts
This is a collection of Roblox scripts that I have worked on. They are intended for use with Roblox Studio.

### Description of scripts
- DungeonMovement - [WIP] User script that overrides the default movement system of Roblox to implement a dungeon crawler style of movement.
- bouncy_slime - [WIP] Server script to create a slime enemy that is similar to the slime from minecraft.
